# Snake

This bundle of component shows how a canvas app with multiple components could be written.

I would recommend looking at all 3 components in the following order:

1. [`snake-launcher`](./snake-launcher)
2. [`snake-main`](./snake-main)
3. [`snake-scoreboard`](./snake-scoreboard)

## How to run this component

- [`ccanvas`](https://github.com/siriusmart/ccanvas) installed in system.
- Install all 3 components components using `cargo install --path .`

Start the canvas using the command below.

```sh
ccanvas snake ccanvas-snake
```
